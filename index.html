                    <p>Raised in Austin, graduate of The University of Texas, I am embarking on the next great challenge of my life: Coding with an emphasis towards Web Development.  I grew up in the amazing city of Austin, Texas and look forward to many more years of working in what is sure to be a tech hub of the southwest.  Thus far in my career of 13 years, I've almost exclusively worked in retail banking, save for a few months delivering pizzas (best job ever!).</p>
                    If I have any free time, you probably won't find me sitting on the couch at home, but rather chasing my golf ball all over creation as I pray to keep my score under 100.  I can also be found cruising down the highway on my motorcycle from time to time, or even possibly pushing around on my skateboard.
